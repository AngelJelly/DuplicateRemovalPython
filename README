===About===

DuplicateRemoval is a simple too created that reads text based files with 
duplicate entries and removes the duplicate entries and writes a new file 
without the duplicate entries. In my work, I deal with large amounts of 
data and much of it is duplicate. Many times I need to analyze this data 
without duplicate entries. So I wrote this program to take care of this 
issue. I use it so frequently, I decided to make it public in hopes someone 
else can find some use of it. This is originally written in C++, but I wrote
it for Python so that way it could be used as a script instead of wasting 
all that time required to compile the C++ code...

===Command Structure===

python DuplicateRemoval.py <input file> <new output file>

I have included a simple text file called "abc.txt" which lists the English 
alphabet with many duplicates. You can run DuplicateRemoval on this file 
just to see that it works!
